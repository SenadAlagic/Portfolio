# Portfolio

This repository is meant to store all my "portfolio" projects. Anything I find online or think of myself I will try and make and push to this repo. These will probably be smaller and thus be saved here, any larger projects will have their own respective repo. None of these are challenging I do admit that, but they serve a different purpose. They aren't here to impress anyone or show off my "skills", these are just to pass some time along. 

Most of these ideas are from **https://mikkegoes.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/**
